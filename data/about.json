    "content": "Cube Shooter is a fast-paced survival shooter where you must outlast endless waves of enemies.\n\nThe goal is simple: survive as long as you can, rack up a high score, and challenge yourself with harder waves. Each round, enemies become faster, tougher, and appear in larger numbers. To keep up, players can collect powerups, manage their ammo, and strategically upgrade their stats between waves.\n\nWith pixel-inspired visuals, retro audio, and a growing set of mechanics, Cube Shooter aims to be both challenging and rewarding — whether you’re here for a quick run or a long session."
